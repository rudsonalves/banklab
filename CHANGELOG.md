## 2026/04/10 — infra/http-client-setup-01

Establishes a **centralized and environment-driven HTTP client configuration**, removing runtime mutation patterns and aligning the mobile client with a more deterministic and infrastructure-oriented design.

### 1. Environment Configuration Refactor

* Introduced `AppEnv` as the single source of truth for runtime configuration:

  * `baseUrl` with strict validation (non-empty and valid URI)
  * `connectTimeout` and `receiveTimeout` via compile-time environment variables
  * `AppMode` enum with explicit parsing and validation
* Removed legacy `EnviromentKey`, eliminating loosely validated configuration access
* This change enforces **fail-fast behavior**, which is a critical improvement for reliability in distributed systems

### 2. HTTP Client Design Simplification

* Removed `setBaseUrl` from `RestClient` interface and its implementation
* Eliminated runtime base URL mutation across the application layer
* All configuration is now resolved at instantiation time via `DioFactory`
* This is a **significant architectural improvement**, as it:

  * removes hidden side effects
  * avoids per-request configuration inconsistencies
  * enforces immutability of infrastructure concerns

### 3. DioFactory Redesign

* Refactored `DioFactory` to return a configured `Dio` instance instead of `RestClient`
* Integrated `AppEnv` directly into `BaseOptions`:

  * `baseUrl`
  * timeouts
  * default headers
* Added support for optional `defaultHeaders`
* Improved interceptor registration:

  * avoids duplicate interceptor instances using type comparison
* This aligns the HTTP client with an **infrastructure-first responsibility model**, consistent with layered architecture principles 

### 4. Dependency Injection Restructuring

* Reorganized `CoreServices` with explicit layering:

  1. `FlutterSecureStorage`
  2. `LocalSecureStorage` abstraction
  3. base `Dio` instance
  4. `AuthInterceptor` with isolated configuration
  5. `RestClient` composed from `Dio`
* Notable design decision:

  * `AuthInterceptor` uses a dedicated `Dio` instance to avoid recursive interception
* This setup improves:

  * testability
  * separation of concerns
  * predictability of request flow

### 5. API Layer Cleanup

* Removed manual base URL overrides from `AuthApi`
* All endpoints now rely on centralized configuration
* This eliminates duplication and prevents divergence across API calls
* Aligns the client with a **contract-driven API consumption model** 

### 6. Interceptor Behavior Clarification

* Updated `AuthInterceptor` comment to explicitly document behavior:

  * skips token injection when `Authorization` header is already present
* Improves readability and reduces ambiguity in request handling

### 7. Test Adjustments

* Updated `DioRestClient` tests:

  * removed dependency on `setBaseUrl`
  * now validate behavior based on `Dio` configuration
* Ensures tests reflect the new immutable configuration model

### Conclusion

This commit represents a **structural upgrade of the HTTP client layer**, shifting from mutable, scattered configuration to a **centralized, deterministic, and environment-driven approach**.

From an architectural standpoint, the most relevant gain is the clear separation between **application logic and infrastructure concerns**, reinforcing the principles of layered architecture and significantly reducing the risk of inconsistent network behavior across the application.


## 2026/04/09 — infra/di-and-env-setup-01

Establishes the **foundational infrastructure layer for dependency injection and environment configuration** in the Flutter client, aligning the mobile architecture with a modular, scalable structure and enabling controlled environment-based execution.

### 1. Development Environment Configuration

* Added `.vscode/launch.json` with predefined run configurations:

  * Dev, Staging, Prod
  * Integration test profile (Dev)
* Each configuration uses `--dart-define-from-file`, enabling **externalized environment configuration**
* Introduced `.env` file strategy (`dev.env`, `staging.env`, `prod.env`) and ensured they are ignored via `.gitignore`
* This approach is technically sound and aligns with production-grade practices for **environment isolation and reproducibility**

### 2. Dependency Injection Setup

* Introduced centralized DI configuration via `dependencies.dart`
* Adopted `AutoInjector` as DI container
* Implemented idempotent initialization (`_initialized` guard)
* Structured registration into modular layers:

  * `CoreServices`
  * `Services`
  * `Data`
* This is a **critical architectural improvement**, bringing the mobile project closer to the same separation principles already present in the backend 

### 3. Core Services Layer

* Added `CoreServices` module:

  * Registers `FlutterSecureStorage`
  * Configures `RestClient` via `DioFactory`
* Environment-driven configuration:

  * `baseUrl` via `EnviromentKey`
  * timeouts defined explicitly
* This enforces **centralized HTTP client configuration**, avoiding scattered setup across the codebase

### 4. Environment Abstraction

* Introduced `EnviromentKey`:

  * Maps compile-time variables using `String.fromEnvironment` and `int.fromEnvironment`
* Supports:

  * base URL
  * timeouts
  * app mode
  * access token (for internal usage)
* This design is particularly robust, as it avoids runtime parsing and ensures **compile-time guarantees**

### 5. Data Layer Composition

* Introduced `Data` module for DI registration:

  * `LocalSecureStorage` abstraction
  * `AuthRepository` implementation
* Proper dependency chaining:

  * Repository depends on API + storage
* This reinforces the **Repository as SSOT pattern**, consistent with your architectural direction

### 6. Services Layer Refactor

* Introduced `Services` module:

  * Registers `AuthApi` with injected `RestClient`
* Removed legacy empty `services.dart`
* Clean separation between:

  * core infrastructure (HTTP, storage)
  * feature services (API layer)

### 7. Authentication Repository Implementation

* Added `AuthRepository` contract and `AuthRepositoryImpl`
* Responsibilities:

  * manage authentication state (`currentUser`, `isLoggedIn`)
  * persist access token
  * handle login, logout, register, and profile
* Introduced explicit unauthenticated handling:

  * new `AppErrorCode.unauthenticated`
* This is a **well-structured implementation**, with clear boundaries between:

  * API (remote)
  * storage (local)
  * state (in-memory)

### 8. Storage and Auth Adjustments

* Renamed `authToken` → `accessToken` for semantic clarity
* Updated `AuthInterceptor` to use new key consistently
* Improved session lifecycle:

  * proper token write on login
  * cleanup on logout and refresh failure
* These changes reduce ambiguity and improve long-term maintainability

### 9. Application Bootstrap

* Updated `main.dart`:

  * introduced `setupDependencies()` before `runApp`
* Ensures all dependencies are resolved prior to UI initialization
* Aligns with proper application lifecycle control

### 10. Minor Improvements

* Adjusted imports in `AuthApi`
* Improved test launch configuration for integration tests
* Small consistency fixes across modules

### Conclusion

This commit introduces a **structural turning point in the mobile application architecture**.

Key gains:

* centralized dependency management
* environment-driven configuration
* clear separation of layers (core, services, data)
* improved authentication flow consistency

From an architectural perspective, this is a **necessary and well-executed foundation**, enabling the project to scale without accumulating coupling or configuration debt.


## 2026/04/09 — theme/composition-01

Introduces a structured **theme composition system** for the Flutter application, including dynamic theme resolution, Material 3 integration, custom typography, and improvements in developer tooling via Makefile refinements.

### 1. Theme Composition Architecture

* Refactored `MainApp` from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget` to support context-dependent initialization
* Introduced controlled theme composition flow:

  * resolve system brightness (`platformBrightness`)
  * select base theme (`light` / `dark`)
  * apply app-level overrides via `_buildAppTheme`
* Encapsulates theme creation logic, improving cohesion and avoiding scattered configuration across widgets
* This approach is conceptually aligned with layered responsibility principles, where configuration is centralized and isolated 

### 2. Material Theme Abstraction

* Added `MaterialTheme` class:

  * centralizes all `ColorScheme` definitions
  * supports multiple variants:

    * light / dark
    * medium contrast
    * high contrast
* Provides factory methods:

  * `light()`, `dark()`, and contrast variations
* Uses Material 3 (`useMaterial3: true`)
* Ensures consistency and scalability of design tokens across the application
* This is a **notable improvement in design maturity**, replacing ad-hoc theming with a reusable and extensible system

### 3. Typography System with Google Fonts

* Introduced `createTextTheme` helper:

  * composes two font families:

    * body font (Quicksand)
    * display font (EB Garamond)
* Uses `google_fonts` package for runtime font resolution
* Merges text styles to preserve semantic roles (`body`, `label`, etc.)
* Enables consistent typography without coupling UI components to font configuration

### 4. Dynamic Theme Initialization

* Theme is initialized in `didChangeDependencies`:

  * ensures access to `BuildContext`
  * avoids unnecessary recomputation
* Separation between:

  * theme construction (`MaterialTheme`)
  * runtime selection (`brightness`)
  * UI overrides (`AppBarTheme`)
* Improves maintainability and testability of UI configuration

### 5. UI Adjustments

* Updated `AppBar` styling:

  * uses `primaryContainer` and `onPrimaryContainer`
  * enforces semi-bold title (`FontWeight.w600`)
* Minor text change in HomePage:

  * "Home Page" → "Type Home Page"

### 6. Dependency Updates

* Added `google_fonts` dependency for typography support
* Introduced transitive dependency `http` (via ecosystem resolution)

### 7. Makefile Improvements

* Added `tests` target:

  * aggregates `api-test` and `mobile-test`
* Renamed Flutter commands for consistency and ergonomics:

  * `flutter-clean` → `fclean`
  * `flutter-build` → `fbuild`
* Added new utility:

  * `fadd pkg=<name>` to simplify dependency installation
* Improves developer experience and standardizes command usage across environments

### Conclusion

This commit establishes a **robust and scalable theming foundation**, transitioning from a basic configuration to a **composable design system** with clear separation of concerns.

From a technical standpoint, the introduction of a dedicated theme layer combined with dynamic resolution and Material 3 alignment significantly improves maintainability, consistency, and long-term extensibility of the UI layer.
